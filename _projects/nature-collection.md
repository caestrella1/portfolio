### Overview

The Nature Collection is a set of graphic artwork created in Adobe Illustrator. It features a variety of popular, scenic locations like Yosemite National Park, Mt. Fuji, and Lovers Point, California. It also features completely fictional landscapes, including snowy mountains, a lonely desert, and a starry mountainscape.

This artwork was created both for my own learning purposes using Adobe Illustrator and as an example of my flat, minimal design techniques.
