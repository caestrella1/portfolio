### Overview

Battle your friends to the death in the midst of a random void in space in this two-player light racer game. Trap your opponent with your line, their line, or the battlefield boundaries and use your boost to destroy their ships and win.

This C++ game was created from the ground up using a custom-made logo and royalty free audio, and vectors. It also placed in the Top 5 of my Programming and Problem-Solving class and is featured on CSU Monterey Bayâ€™s Game Research Lab website.
