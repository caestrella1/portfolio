### Overview

Guide PAC-MAN through the maze as you consume pellets, chase ghosts, and collect fruits. Consume all the pellets to advance to the next stage. Munch on a Power Pellet to temporarily allow ghosts to be eaten. But be carefulâ€”Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde adapt quickly to survive.

Built using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and modeled after the original PAC-MAN arcade game, this version attempts to mimic the classic arcade game while adding additional improvements to functionality. Thanks to SFML, cross-platform functionality is built-in, which makes it a breeze to run the code on the operating system of your choice.

#### How to Run
- To run the project on macOS, simply select `PAC-MAN.xcodeproj` and open in XCode.
- To run the project on Windows, select `PAC-MAN.sln` and point your compiler to the appropriate SFML 2.4.2 files.

#### Possible Future Updates
- Implement a Pathfinding Algorithm for the ghosts and use their original AI.
- Represent the world with tiles and load mazes from text files.
