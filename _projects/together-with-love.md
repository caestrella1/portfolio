### Overview

Together with Love is an annual 5K/10K charity event held in Pacific Grove, California and hosted by the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center (MCRCC), a non-profit organization providing services for victims of sexual assault, human trafficking, and child abuse.

I was among 25 students in my Graphic Design class at California State University, Monterey Bay tasked with creating a design for their 33rd annual event. Though these designs were not used, they represent my debut to the world of design and showcase my minimalistic design concepts.
