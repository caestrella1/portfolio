### Overview

Nox is an iOS theme made for the Anemone and Snowboard theming engines. Featuring pure black icons, Nox is perfect for users with OLED displays looking for a complete Dark Mode experience without having to sacrifice the stock iOS look and feel.

#### Features
- 260 Home Screen icons
- 30 alternate icons
- Black notification badges
- Settings icons
- 40 General Purpose icons **(SnowBoard only)**


#### General Purpose Icons
Nox's general purpose icons are made to give users more choices for their unthemed apps in between updates. To use general purpose icons, you must be using SnowBoard. ***This will not work with Anemone 3 at the moment***, as Anemone doesn't support alternate icons anymore. Using SnowBoard's alternate icon picker, tap on "All Icons" and in the search bar, type in "NOX-" to see all icons or type in a keyword like "music" or "transportation".
