### Overview

Nox is an iOS theme made for the Anemone and Snowboard theming engines. Featuring pure black icons, Nox is perfect for users with OLED displays looking for a complete Dark Mode experience without having to sacrifice the stock iOS look and feel.

***This theme is no longer supported. No requests will be taken and the theme is now free on Packix.***

#### Features
- 300 Home Screen icons
- 20+ alternate icons
- Glyph, Dark, and Black icon modes (underlays)
- Red, Dark, and Black notification badges
- 40 General Purpose icons **(SnowBoard only)**
- Settings icons (iOS 12)

#### General Purpose Icons
Nox's general purpose icons are made to give users more choices for their unthemed apps in between updates. To use general purpose icons, you must be using SnowBoard. ***This will not work with Anemone 3 at the moment***, as Anemone doesn't support alternate icons anymore. Using SnowBoard's alternate icon picker, tap on "All Icons" and in the search bar, type in "NOX-" to see all icons or type in a keyword like "music" or "transportation".

#### Recommended SnowBoard Extensions
- **SnowBoard Icon Effects** (if you plan to use the underlays/backgrounds)
- **SnowBoard Settings Icons** (if you plan to use the settings icons)
