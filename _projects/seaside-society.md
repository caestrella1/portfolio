### Overview

The **Seaside Society** is an organization in Seaside, California whose purpose is to promote social, cultural, intellectual, and international exchange among its participants and the community it serves, as well as the promotion of ethical leadership, academic achievement, and civic responsibility.

I was contacted by Yollette Merritt, a member of the organization, in May 2019 and tasked with creating its image using a seahorse as the heart of the design.

#### A Work in Progress

To say that this logo was a work in progress is an understatement. The logo went through countless revisions before it became what it is today. Right from the start, I wanted to play with the idea of the seahorse being an "S" in "Seaside Society." Several snake- and dragon-like revisions later, I realized that this idea wasn't going to make the cut.

#### Back to Basics

It was at this point that I was re-evaluating the original image I was given to work with. Rather than creating the design from thin air, I decided to study images of seahorses and try to mimic the look of a *real* seahorse. 

Although I certainly improved from my snake- and dragon-like designs, it still didn't quite sit right. All I could see now was either a duck or a horse.

#### The Golden Ratio

I sat and pondered about how I could fix the current design. My client wanted me to use the original image for *something* and I was back to wanting an abstract piece. Then it hit me&mdash;***the golden ratio***. 

I studied the idea closely and decided to give it a shot and boy was I glad I did it. What seemed like a tangled mess of circles quickly (and very satisfyingly) became the new face of The Seaside Society.
