### Overview

Madi Rapella is a Digital & Fine Artist currently pursuing a degree in Visual and Public Art at California State University, Monterey Bay. She mainly works in digital and acrylic mediums and conveys the stories of people and animals through a realistic portraiture style.

#### Development

The portfolio website was developed from strach using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a custom Bootstrap build. To allow her the same content management capabilities as WordPress without the databases and excess bulk, the site was built with the help of [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/)â€“a CMS for generating and managing static sites with a git backend.

#### Design

Rapella's website features a simple design, a light pink and rose-like color scheme and her signature logo at the forefront of each page. Large, prominent images with sharp edges and subtle drop shadows are used site-wide to accentuate the art. All this, paired with [Laila](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila) headings and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) body text, makes for a clean and aesthetically pleasing website.
