### Overview

[The Lutrinae](https://thelutrinae.com/) is a weekly student-run newspaper covering [California State University, Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/) and its neighboring areas. Formerly known as *The Otter Realm*, *The Lutrinae* brings modern designs, integration with social media and online tools, and ultimately, a newspaper that is made for students, by students.

#### Work Background

In 2017, I became a part of the creative process that helped rebrand CSU Monterey Bay's student-run newspaper. I am responsible for the daily maintenance of *The Lutrinae's* website, social media and all other web-related services as well as contributing to student recruitment at school events.

#### Design

*The Lutrinae* features a simple design and light color scheme as well as carefully picked serif and sans serif font pairings: Raleway for headers and detail text, and Libre Bakersville for article titles and body text.

The site has undergone two major redesigns since its start, with each revision providing a more streamlined and customized experience. The WordPress website runs a customized version of tagDiv's [Newspaper theme](https://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609), which adds functionality for the [Co-Authors Plus plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/), appropriately displaying multiple co-authors and guest authors throughout the site.

Although this is my final major redesign before graduating, I will continue to improve upon the site as my skills evolve and eventually pursue a career in web development and web design in the future.
