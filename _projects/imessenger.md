### Overview

iMessenger is an Apple-styled Slack-inspired group chat app developed in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Pusher Chatkit's API](https://pusher.com/chatkit). It allows users to create and join chat rooms and send messages to friends. **Development on this project has been suspended until further notice. Feel free to explore the soruce code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cestrrada/imessenger)**.


#### Features
- Create new chat rooms
- Send messages to chat room members
- Slack-styled emoji picker using [Emoji-Mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart)
- New message notifications
- Unread indicators
- Delete chat rooms
- Dark/Light Mode toggle
- Desktop support only

#### Future Development
If this project were to continue, iMessenger could become a full-fledged messaging app with a login and registration system. Additional features to improve user experience would include typing indicators, showing only joined chat rooms in a user's list, and a search form for finding new chat rooms.
