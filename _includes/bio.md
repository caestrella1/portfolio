## Hello world...
My name is **Carlos** and I'm a Computer Science student at [California State University, Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Since beginning my journey as a developer in 2016, I have helped develop several games, software, and websites. 

After graduating, I hope to pursue a career in web development focusing on either UI/UX or backend development.
