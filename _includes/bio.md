### About Me
My name is **Carlos** and I'm a Computer Science student at [California State University, Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Since beginning my journey as a developer in 2016, I have helped develop several games, software, and websites, where I also focused heavily on UI/UX. I hope to pursue a career in full-stack web development after graduating.
