### About Me
My name is **Carlos** and I'm a Computer Science student at [California State University, Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Since beginning my journey as a developer in 2016, I have helped develop several games, software, and websites, where I also focused heavily on UI/UX. I hope to pursue a career in full-stack web development after graduating.

<!-- As a Computer Science student, Carlos has always had a deep fascination for technology and how it can be used to create the tools we use in our everyday lives. As a designer, I’ve also come to notice the importance of an application’s UI/UX. For these reasons, I am a firm believer that successful solutions are not just functional, but elegant and intuitive as well. -->
